# 🌧️ Climate + Crowd Resilient Smart Traffic Twin

## 🚀 Overview
ClimateCrowd-TrafficTwin is an advanced traffic simulation system designed to model the impact of varying climate conditions and crowd surges on urban traffic flow. This digital twin empowers city planners and traffic engineers to optimize traffic management strategies under diverse environmental and population scenarios.

## ⚡ Key Features
- **Real-time Traffic Simulation:** Visualize traffic flow with dynamic metrics and interactive controls.
- **Climate Impact Modeling:** Simulate effects of weather conditions such as rain, heat, and clear skies on traffic patterns.
- **Crowd Surge Analysis:** Assess how sudden increases in population density affect congestion and traffic behavior.
- **Heuristic & Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:** Employ advanced traffic control strategies for optimized flow.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** User-friendly Streamlit interface for scenario testing and visualization.
- **Performance Metrics:** Monitor throughput, wait times, and collision statistics for comprehensive analysis.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python-based simulation engine with modular design.
- **Frontend:** Streamlit dashboard for real-time interaction and visualization.
- **Algorithms:** Heuristic and Reinforcement Learning (RL) based traffic control strategies.

## 📊 Simulation Parameters
- **Weather Conditions:** Clear, Rain, Heat.
- **Crowd Levels:** From 0.0 (normal) to 1.0 (maximum surge).
- **Time Steps:** Configurable simulation duration.
